This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating a practical and smooth user experience.

## Overview

I designed this project to incorporate key skills and techniques I've learned, including a mobile-first approach in HTML, flexible layout with Flexbox in CSS, and interactive elements using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Features

- **HTML:** Implemented a mobile-first approach emphasizing responsiveness, semantics, and accessibility.
  
- **CSS:** Utilized Flexbox for layout, incorporated a utility CSS approach inspired by Traversy Media's modern CSS/HTML bootcamp, and expressed design concepts through color.

- **JavaScript:** Integrated features like a lightbox for multimedia content and smooth scrolling effects within the navigation bar, learned from Traversy Media's bootcamp.
