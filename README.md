This project that showcases:
HTML, CSS, and since I'm diving deeper into JavaScript I begin a bit of JavaScript and Jquery. I wanted the user experience in this page to be practical and smooth as the user flows from page to page via the <a> elements (links).

HTML:
I focused on a mobile first approach and examined responsivness, semantics, and accessibility.

CSS:
With CSS I wanted to focus my studies on flexbox, accessibility, working with a utility CSS page I learned from Traversey media in the modern CSS/HTML bootcamp.
 I wanted to express the energy, determination and enthusiasm for learning code through color. 

JavaScript:
Finally, from the T.M bootcamp I was introduced to lightbox which I find to be brilliant in design and implementation. 
 In addition, I studied a smooth scrolling effect, which is demonstrated in the navigation bar.

Freecode bookcamp required a technical page, a landing page, and a portfolio. So, I  incorporated all three using what I learned from Traversey Medias bootcamp.
