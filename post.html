      <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
      <p class="meta">
        <i class="fas fa-user"></i>Posted by <strong> Nick M.</strong>| May 19 2020
      </p>
      <img src="JavaScript_web_design.jpg" alt="JavaScript web design">
      <p> In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?"
        and
        "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purposes.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="a_high_definition" class="main-section post">
      <h2>A high-level definition</h2>
      <p> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
        pages —
        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
        displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
        etc. —
        you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
        technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
        Area.</p>
      <img id='cake' src="cake.png" alt="the layers of front end development">
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example
          defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
        <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting
          background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
          multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what
          you
          can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example. We can
        mark
        it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:
        <code>
          1|&lt;p&gt;Player 1:Zoe&lt;p/&gt;
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>player 1: Zoe</p>
      <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
      <code>
        p {
        font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
        letter-spacing: 1px;<br>
        text-transform: uppercase;<br>
        text-align: center;<br>
        border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);<br>
        background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);<br>
        color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);<br>
        box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);<br>
        border-radius: 10px;<br>
        padding: 3px 10px;<br>
        display: inline-block;<br>
        cursor: pointer;<br>
        }
      </code>
      <p class="css-example">player 1: Zoe</p>
      <p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:</p>
      <code>
        const para = document.querySelector('p');<br>

        para.addEventListener('click', updateName);<br>

        function updateName() {<br>
        let name = prompt('Enter a new name');<br>
        para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;<br>
        }
      </code>
      <p id="js-example"></p>
      <p>JavaScript can do a lot more than that — let's explore what in more detail.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="so_what_can_it_really_do" class="main-section post">
      <h2>So what can it really do?</h2>

      <p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do
        things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be
          entered
          then store that name in a variable called name.</li>
        <li>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the
          string
          "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".
        </li>
        <li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example
          above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript
        language.
        So-called <bold>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</bold> provide you with extra superpowers to use
        in
        your JavaScript code.</p>
      <p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would
        otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made
        furniture
        kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a
        bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to
        the
        right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>
      <p> They generally fall into two categories.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="browser_API's" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Browser API's</h2>
      <p>
        <bold>Browser APIs </bold>are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding
        computer environment, or do useful complex things. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span class="gry-hl">DOM (Document Object Model) API</span> allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS,
          creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you
          see a
          popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for
          example,
          that's the DOM in action.</li>
        <li>The <span class="gry-hl">Geolocation API</span> retrieves geographical information. This is how Google
          Maps
          is able to find your location and plot it on a map.</li>
        <li>The <span class="gry-hl">Canvas</span> and <span class="gry-hl">WebGL</span> APIs allow you to create
          animated 2D and 3D graphics. People are doing some amazing things using these web technologies —see Chrome
          Experiments and webglsamples.</li>
        <li>Audio and Video APIs like <span class="gry-hl">HTMLMediaElement</span> and <span
            class="gry-hl">WebRTC</span> allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia, such as play
          audio
          and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's
          computer
          (try our simple Snapshot demo to get the idea).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="third_party_API's" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Third party API's</h2>
      <p>The Twitter API allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.
        The Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap API allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such
        functionality.</p>
      <p>There's a lot more available, too! However, don't get over excited just yet. You won't be able to build the
        next Facebook, Google Maps, or Instagram after studying JavaScript for 24 hours — there are a lot of basics
        to
        cover first. And that's why you're here — let's move on!</p>
    </section>
    <section id="What_is_JavaScript_doing_on_your_page?" class="main-section post">
      <h2>What is JavaScript doing on your page?</h2>
      <p> Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so, explore what actually happens when you
        run
        some JavaScript in your page.</p>
      <p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in
        our
        How CSS works article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS,
        and
        JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw
        materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
      <img id="execution" src="execution.png" alt="execution of html,css,JavaScript">
      <p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the
        Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded
        and
        executed in the order it appears on the page. If the JavaScript loads and tries to run before the HTML and
        CSS
        it is affecting has been loaded, errors can occur. You will learn ways around this later in the article, in
        the
        Script loading strategies section.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="browser_Security" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Browser security</h2>
      <p>Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets are called "execution
        environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely
        separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab — or on another website.
        This
        is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates could start writing code to steal
        information from other websites, and other such bad things.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="javaScript_running order" class="main-section post">
      <h2>JavaScript running order </h2>
      <p> When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This
        means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to the block of
        JavaScript we saw in our first example:</p>
      <code>
        const para = document.querySelector('p');<br>

        para.addEventListener('click', updateName);<br>

        function updateName() { <br>
        let name = prompt('Enter a new name'); <br>
        para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name; <br>
        }
      </code>
      <p>Here we are selecting a text paragraph (line 1), then attaching an event listener to it (line 3) so that
        when
        the paragraph is clicked, the updateName() code block (lines 5–8) is run. The updateName() code block (these
        types of reusable code blocks are called "functions") asks the user for a new name, and then inserts that
        name
        into the paragraph to update the display.</p>
      <p>If you swapped the order of the first two lines of code, it would no longer work — instead, you'd get an
        error
        returned in the browser developer console — TypeError: para is undefined. This means that the para object
        does
        not exist yet, so we can't add an event listener to it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="interpreted_versus_compiled_code" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Interpreted versus compiled code</h2>
      <p>You might hear the terms <bold>interpreted</bold> and <bold>compiled</bold> in the context of programming.
        In
        interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately
        returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is
        received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.</p>
      <p>Compiled languages on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by
        the
        computer. For example, C/C++ are compiled into assembly language that is then run by the computer. The
        program
        is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code
        in
        its original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript
        interpreters actually use a technique called <bold>just-in-time compiling</bold> to improve performance; the
        JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it
        can
        be run as quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreteted language, since the
        compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.</p>
      <p>There are advantages to both types of language, but we won't discuss them right now.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="server_v_client" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Server-side versus client-side code</h2>
      <p> You might also hear the terms <bold>server-side</bold> and <bold>client-side</bold> code, especially in
        the
        context of web development. Client-side code is code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is
        viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser. In this module we
        are
        explicitly talking about client-side JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Server-side code on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in
        the
        browser. Examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET and... JavaScript!
        JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environment — you
        can
        find out more about server-side JavaScript in our Dynamic Websites – Server-side programming topic.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="dynamic_v_static" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Dynamic versus static code</h2>
      <p>
        The word dynamic is used to describe both client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages — it refers to
        the
        ability to update the display of a web page/app to show different things in different circumstances,
        generating
        new content as required. Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the server, e.g. pulling data
        from a database, whereas client-side JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the
        client, e.g. creating a new HTML table, filling it with data requested from the server, then displaying the
        table in a web page shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in the two contexts, but related,
        and
        both approaches (server-side and client-side) usually work together.</p>
      <p>A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as <bold>static</bold> — it just shows the
        same
        content all the time.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="add_javascript" class="main-section post">
      <h2>How do you add JavaScript to your page?</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses <span class="gry-hl">
          &lt;link&gt;</span>elements to apply external stylesheets and <span class="gry-hl">&lt;style&gt;</span>
        elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the
        <span class="gry-hl">&lt;script&gt;</span> element. Let's learn how this works.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="internal_js" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Internal JavaScript</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>First of all, make a local copy of our example file apply-javascript.html. Save it in a directory
          somewhere
          sensible.</li>
        <li>Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web
          page containing a clickable button.</li>
        <li>Next, go to your text editor and add the following in your head — just before your closing </head> tag:
        </li>
        <code>
          &lt;script&gt;<br>
          // JavaScript goes here <br>
          &lt;/script&gt; <br>
        </code>
        <li>Now we'll add some JavaScript inside our &lt;script&gt; element to make the page do something more
          interesting — add the following code just below the
          <code> "// JavaScript goes here" </code> line:</li>
        <code>
          document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {<br>
          function createParagraph() {<br>
          let para = document.createElement('p');<br>
          para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';<br>
          document.body.appendChild(para);<br>
          } <br>

          const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button'); <br>

          for(let i = 0; i &lt; buttons.length ; i++) { <br>
          buttons[i].addEventListener <br>('click', createParagraph); } }); <br>
        </code> <br>
        <li>Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button, a
          new paragraph is generated and placed below.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="external_js" class="main-section post">
      <h2>External JavaScript</h2>
      <p> This works great, but what if we wanted to put our JavaScript in an external file? Let's explore this now.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, create a new file in the same directory as your sample HTML file. Call it <span
            class="gry-hl">script.js</span> — make sure it
          has that .js filename extension, as that's how it is recognized as JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Replace your current <span class="gry-hl">&lt;script&gt;</span> element with the following:
        </li>
        <code>
          &lt;script src="script.js" defergt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
        <li>Inside <span class="gry-hl">script.js</span>, add the following script:</li>
        <code>
          function createParagraph() { <br>
          let para = document.createElement('p');<br>
          para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';<br>
          document.body.appendChild(para);<br>

        <li>Save and refresh your browser, and you should see the same thing! It works just the same, but now we've
          got
          our JavaScript in an external file. This is generally a good thing in terms of organizing your code and
          making
          it reusable across multiple HTML files. Plus, the HTML is easier to read without huge chunks of script
          dumped
          in it.</li>

      <h2>Inline JavaScript</h2>
      <p> Note that sometimes you'll come across bits of actual JavaScript code living inside HTML. </p>
      <p><strong>Please don't do this</strong>, however. It is bad practice to pollute your HTML with JavaScript,
        and it
        is inefficient — you'd have to include the onclick="createParagraph()" attribute on every button you want
        the
        JavaScript to apply to.</p>

    <section id="loading" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Script loading strategies</h2>
      <p>There are a number of issues involved with getting scripts to load at the right time. Nothing is as simple
        as
        it seems! A common problem is that all the HTML on a page is loaded in the order in which it appears. If you
        are
        using JavaScript to manipulate elements on the page (or more accurately, the Document Object Model), your
        code
        won't work if the JavaScript is loaded and parsed before the HTML you are trying to do something to.</p>
      <p>In the above code examples, in the internal and external examples the JavaScript is loaded and run in the
        head
        of the document, before the HTML body is parsed. This could cause an error, so we've used some constructs to
        get
        around it.</p>
      <p>In the internal example, you can see this structure around the code:</p>
      <code>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {<br>
        ... <br>
        });
      </code>
      <p>This is an event listener, which listens for the browser's "DOMContentLoaded" event, which signifies that
        the
        HTML body is completely loaded and parsed. The JavaScript inside this block will not run until after that
        event
        is fired, therefore the error is avoided (you'll learn about events later in the course).</p>
      <p>In the external example, we use a more modern JavaScript feature to solve the problem, the <span
          class="gry-hl">defer</span> attribute,
        which tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML content once the <span class="gry-hl">
          &lt;script&gt;</span> tag element has been
        reached.</p>
      <code>
        &lt;script src="script.js" defer&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
      </code>
      <p>In this case both the script and the HTML will load simultaneously and the code will work.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="async_defer" class="main-section post">
      <h2>async and defer</h2>
      <p>There are actually two modern features we can use to bypass the problem of the blocking script — <span
          class="gry-hl">async</span> and
        <span class="gry-hl">defer</span> (which we saw above). Let's look at the difference between these two.</p>
      <p>Scripts loaded using the <span class="gry-hl">async</span> attribute (see below) will download the script
        without blocking rendering the
        page and will execute it as soon as the script finishes downloading. You get no guarantee that scripts will
        run
        in any specific order, only that they will not stop the rest of the page from displaying. It is best to use
        <span class="gry-hl">async</span> when the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend
        on
        no other script on the page.
      </p>
      <p>For example, if you have the following script elements:</p>
      <code>
        &lt;script async src="js/vendor/jquery.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;<br>

        &lt;script async src="js/script2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>

        &lt;script async src="js/script3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
      </code>
      <p>You can't rely on the order the scripts will load in. <span class="gry-hl">jquery.js</span> may load before
        or
        after <span class="gry-hl">script2.js</span> and
        <span class="gry-hl">script3.js</span> and if this is the case, any functions in those scripts depending on
        <span class="gry-hl">jquery</span> will produce an error
        because <span class="gry-hl">jquery</span> will not be defined at the time the script runs.</p>
      <p><span class="gry-hl">async</span> should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to load in,
        and
        you just want to get them in
        place asap. For example, maybe you have some game data files to load, which will be needed when the game
        actually begins, but for now you just want to get on with showing the game intro, titles, and lobby, without
        them being blocked by script loading.</p>
      <p>Scripts loaded using the <span class="gry-hl">defer</span> attribute (see below) will run in the order they
        appear in the page and execute
        them as soon as the script and content are downloaded:</p>
      <code>
        &lt;script defer src="js/vendor/jquery.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;<br>

        &lt;script defer src="js/script2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>

        &lt;script defer src="js/script3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
      </code>

      <p>All the scripts with the <span class="gry-hl">defer</span> attribute will load in the order they appear on
        the
        page. So in the second
        example, we can be sure that <span class="gry-hl">jquery.js</span> will load before <span
          class="gry-hl">script2.js</span> and <span class="gry-hl">script3.js</span> and that <span
          class="gry-hl">script2.js</span> will load
        before <span class="gry-hl">script3.js</span>. They won't run until the page content has all loaded, which
        is
        useful if your scripts depend
        on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one of more elements on the page).</p>
      <p>To summarize:</p>
      <p><span class="gry-hl">async </span>and <span class="gry-hl">defer</span> both instruct the browser to
        download
        the script(s) in a separate thread, while the rest of the
        page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.</p>
      <p>If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use <span
          class="gry-hl">async</span>.</p>
      <p>
        If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load
        them
        using <span class="gry-hl">defer</span> and put their corresponding<span class="gry-hl">
          &lt;script&gt;</span>
        elements
        in the order you want the browser to execute
        them.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="comments" class="main-section post">
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p> As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be ignored by
        the
        browser, and exist simply to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works (and you,
        if
        you come back to your code after six months and can't remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and
        you
        should use them often, particularly for larger applications. There are two types:</p>
      <p>A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (//), e.g.
        // I am a comment</p>
      <code>
        // I am a comment
      </code>
      <p>A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */, e.g.
      </p>
      <code>
        /*
        I am also <br>
        a comment <br>
        */
      </code>
      <p>So for example, we could annotate our last demo's JavaScript with comments like so:</p>
      <code>
        // Function: creates a new paragraph and appends it to the bottom of the HTML body. <br>

        // Function: creates a new paragraph and appends it to the bottom of the HTML body. <br>

        function createParagraph() { <br>
        let para = document.createElement('p'); <br>
        para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!'; <br>
        document.body.appendChild(para); <br>
        }

        /*
        1. Get references to all the buttons on the page in an array format. <br>
        2. Loop through all the buttons and add a click event listener to each one. <br>

        When any button is pressed, the createParagraph() function will be run. <br>
        */

        const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button'); <br>

        for (let i = 0; i &lt; buttons.length ; i++) { <br>
        buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph); <br>
        }
      </code>
      <p>Note: In general more comments are usually better than less, but you should be careful if you find yourself
        adding lots of comments to explain what variables are (your variable names perhaps should be more
        intuitive), or
        to explain very simple operations (maybe your code is overcomplicated).</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript. We've begun with just theory, to start
        getting
        you used to why you'd use JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it. Along the way, you saw a
        few
        code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in with the rest of the code on your website, amongst other
        things.</p>
      <p>JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in this course, we will take you through it
        in
        simple steps that will make sense going forward. In the next article, we will plunge straight into the
        practical, getting you to jump straight in and build your own JavaScript</p>
